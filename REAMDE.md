Nilakantha is an algorithm for calculating pi, and this implementation is a simple **multi-threaded** console app.
I know, very *fancy*.

Nice little loading bar, and will continuously update the approximation as it converges on Pi.

## Dependencies:
Requires GMP (https://gmplib.org/) - the Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library.

Run `make install-deps` from command line to try installing it using `apt`.

## Building The Code:

Use `make` in the command line to build `Nila` - the executable.
